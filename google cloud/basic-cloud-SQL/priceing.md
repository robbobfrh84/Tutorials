# Pricing!

Please note that by default you will be using the `db-n1-standard-1` pricing model, which will eat up for $300 free bucks at a rate of around $47 a month!

To change to a cheaper/testing option. Go go to your instance in the GC console and click `edit`

- Then find and click `Configure machine type and storage`
- click `Change`
- select the smallest type: `db-f1-micro` for a shared server use.

But honestly.... If you're just testing, you might as well "STOP" the database. You can always turn it back on if you want.
